# *Change Your Brain Neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman | Rich Roll Podcast*

• The desire to be part of the community.

• The fracture of communities.

• There were people in my path who pushed me to the right like tutor or mentor classes. Things like meditating, doing my homework, being organized, reflecting on my actions, thinking, doing, executing, reflecting on my mistakes.

• The human brain is not built to make the best choices.

• Body, brain and mind are connected, integrated in several ways.

• Perception is negotiable, the sensations of things, the feelings. Thoughts are quick and behaviors are solid , concrete and consolidated. Behavior need to be first, then thoughts feelings and perceptions, mood too. i will explain in next points.

• External demands are frequent, they influence the human system, the agitation of stress mobilizes the body for the challenge, it is the heart of the system. It makes us move. Brains adjust to optimize new learning, some events of perception.

• Throughout the day we do reflective acts, the brain loves to be able to do reflective acts, not to consume so much energy. Thinking a lot is stressful, a good example is the year 2020, everyone in quarantine needed to think about all these things, more than before with so many distractions.

• Turn on the brain in agitation and frustration, to stay alert, so our attention will gain more focus and efficiency.

• Studies show that children indirectly practice these concepts and then discover new things to learn and absorb, it is natural behavior. They achieve this more quickly and efficiently, even breaking their faces sometimes, falling off the bicycle.

• Sense of urgency is a good way to hack the brain. You can enter the flow more efficiently, because the focus component is also participating in this integration.

• These last points explain how children are so good in puzzle, games.

• Pain points , dopamina, still power, energy when a team wins another. Feel the moment of all training, the difficulties, you really deserve it. Infinite power for focus. 

• But dopamina for easy rewards is vicious in life, not effective.

• Controlling the field of thought is complicated, you start to negotiate within yourself, but it is a long way of understanding and wearing out the mind. The behavior to assume the position, choice or responsibility is more direct to the target, it immediately makes you act, you don't think much, you just do and correct your mistakes.

• Freeze, you can go back or forward.
There are two groups of people, 1- those who are not motivated 2- and we have people who can oxygenate the brain, generating stress and active adrenaline to make decisions quickly, quick choices in which we have little wear, low energy used, to reach the high need goals, big challenges.

• Focus on one thing and panoramic focus on everything, you can turn it on and off to save energy. There are times when you need only one focus, kind of attention, it's like a blur around you.

• The next generation will better understand these concepts, to make better decisions, to understand their capabilities. My generation needs to go through this culture of reflection, self-knowledge.
